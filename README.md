After learning about use of Monte Carlo simulations in finance, applied a simple version to find out probability of winning at roulette betting on 1 number at different versions of roulette.

Versions of roulette:
  - American where there are 2 Zeros
  - Eu where there is 1 Zero
  - Non zero roulette
  

Looking to expand use of this onto a stock price
